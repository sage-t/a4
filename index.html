            <h2>Llamas are great</h2>
            <p>
                Llamas come from the Andes mountains and are possibly the most self reliant domesticated animal.
            </p>

            <h3>Why they're great</h3>
            <p>
                Llamas can attack mountain lions with their sharp toes. They also can "spit" up to 10 feet. Their "spit" is actually acid from their first stomach and it can be used to blind predators. Llamas can live comfortably in the desert, snow, forest, mountains, and were bred for the high altitude. They are also similar to camels where they can go for almost a week with little water. They can even carry 1/3 to 1/2 of their body weight through dangerous terrain.
            </p>

            <h3>Llamas aren't perfect</h3>
            <p>
                Llamas need strong social circles. Without at least one friend they'll become very agressive. Similar to horses, they have a mind of their own and can take years to train. Also, because of their limited number in the USA, it can be difficult to avoid inbreeding.
